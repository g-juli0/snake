# snake

I created this version of the snake game after my high-school class coded a very basic version of it. I added a ton of features just for fun and work on it periodically when I'm bored. My friends and I would play it to pass time in our classes throughout high school and now college too. Feel free to download and try it/add to it yourself. Just make sure you have pygame installed and have both required sound files and required text file.
